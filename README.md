# Dashvocado App

This is a minimal Dash web app visualising the data in [this Avocado prices dataset in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices), majorly following [this tutorial on RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-dash/).

**Dash** is a web framework made for data scientists who have enough HTML and CSS knowledge to enable them to build data visualisations onto a web page. It's like writing HTML, but in Python syntax... or like writing a React app but without any Javascript...
